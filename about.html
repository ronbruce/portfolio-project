<p>Ron Bruce, who goes by the stage name, Jamal Saturn is a talented singer-songwriter who has been honing his craft since the age of 14. Though he began his creative journey as a dancer, where he won 2nd prize in The Bahamas Best Dance Crew competition with the group Swiftz, Jamal always had a passion for music and songwriting.

    After impressing the director of the dance company Classique with his vocal talent, Jamal was given the opportunity to perform live at one of their most memorable shows, Zig Zag. It was around this time that he recorded his first song, "I'm Letting You Go," with the talented producer Fojo.
    
    Since then, Jamal has been unstoppable in his pursuit of creating and recording music. He has worked with a number of talented artists, including Shelly G, Big Red, and Fojo. With a natural gift for songwriting and a smooth, soulful voice, he has captured the hearts of many fans around the world thanks to social media and YouTube.
    
    Jamalâ€™s music is a fusion of genres, blending elements of R&B, pop, and reggae into a unique sound that is entirely his own. Follow him on his musical journey and experience the magic of his music for yourself.</p>
